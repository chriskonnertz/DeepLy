Version 2.1
===

Differences to DeepLy version 2.0 are:
- Deactivated deprecated method `translateFile()`. It still exists but if you call it an exception is going to be thrown
- Added  support for Korean and Norwegian languages
- Added `resetSettings()` method (a convenient helper method that you can use instead of `setSettings()`)
